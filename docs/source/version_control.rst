Version control
===============

Version control is important for many reasons. It allows you to keep track of
changes, and to revert to previous versions if needed. It also allows you to
try out new things without breaking a stable version of your code, which is
especially useful if you're working with others. There are several version 
control systems (Git, Mercurial, SVN, etc.). For this project, `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_
is used.

Independent of version control is choosing a platform to host your project,
which can also help in the reproducibility of your code by allowing others to
conveniently access your code. Example platforms for Git are GitHub, GitLab,
and Bitbucket. GitHub is the most popular, and is used for this project.

More on Git and GitHub can be found in this `tutorial <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D1_JywMl2rjaeuVzpykPBOJsDIuwQKGOJB4EFZjej2s/edit#slide=id.g2eaa4b61f15_0_336>`_.
